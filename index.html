                The Bengal tiger is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies and the nominate tiger
                subspecies.It ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today.It is considered to belong to the world's
                charismatic megafauna.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The tiger is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for
                about 12,000 to 16,500 years.Today, it is threatened by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and
                was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. None of the Tiger Conservation
                Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than
                250 adult individuals.

                India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and southwestern China.India's tiger population was estimated at
                2,603-3,346 individuals by 2018.Around 300-500 individuals are estimated in Bangladesh by 2015,355 in
                Nepal by 2022,and 90 individuals in Bhutan by 2015.
